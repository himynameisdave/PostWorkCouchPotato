Simplifies watching [r/videos](http://reddit.com/r/videos).

Born out of the fact that I love to come home after work and clicking through the r/videos feed to see all the cool stuff people have found during the day.

It was also a chance for me to test out modularizing my JavaScript by using [Require](http://requirejs.org/).
