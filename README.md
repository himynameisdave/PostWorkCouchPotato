Simplifies watching [r/videos](http://reddit.com/r/videos).

Born out of the fact that I love to come home after work and clicking through the r/videos feed to see all the cool stuff people have found during the day. I didn't realize that [reddit.tv](http://reddit.tv) was a thing until after I had already built the thing. OH WELL!

It was also a chance for me to test out modularizing my JavaScript by using [Require](http://requirejs.org/).
